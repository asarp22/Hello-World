# Hello-World
This repository is for practising GitHub Flow

My name is augustine, I am new here and want to learn coding. 
I am a chemical engineer who want to divert into ML and AI.
I am new to coding and trying to learn python all by myself but its complicated doing this alone.
I enjoy everything that i see on this platform.
